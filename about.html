        <p>Growing up, I had no formal dance training or exposure. The most dance I ever particiapted in were dances hosted by my local church congregations and the high schools I went to. </p>
        <p>I've always loved dancing, by I really grew to feel comfortable doing it infront of people when I turned 15 and went to my first high school dance as a member of the student council.
            I felt encouraged by the people all around me who were ready to dance with me and were excited to just be out there having a good time.
        </p>
        <p>It was there that I learned that dancing, at it's heart, is a way that we as people have fun with others. It's a moment when we can, as the popular song says, "release our inhibitions!" 
            It's a space were we can just listen the music, feel the pulse of the beat, and go with the flow. 
        </p>
        <p>By the time I went to college, I still had never seen professionals, or even serious-minded people, dancing. It seemed like something you only did when the situation called for it, never else. 
            It was then that I decided to take a Intro to American Social Dance class, and everything changed from there.
        </p>
        <p> Initally, I thought it was pretty fun! It was cool to hear songs that I recognzied from the radio and be able to say "This is a Cha-Cha!" or whatever dance was appropriate, but I had no intention of getting serious about it.</p>
        <p> As a part of the class however, we had to compete at a Ballroom Dance Competition. It just so happened that the semester I was taking the class was the same semester my school was hosting the US Nation Championships For Ballroom Dance.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a naturally competitive person, and as soon as I head I'd be competing I found the person in class I danced the best with, asked them to compete with me, and we began to practice with the hopes of getting to finals.</p>
        <p>When that day finally came, the magic in the air was something I had only found at Track Meets in High School, yet I felt none of the nervousness. All around me were people of various ages competing for national titles, and it was magical to watch them perform inbetween my events! Even more magical was the judges repeated calling me and my partner back to dance and compete time and time again, until we had reached the final round. </p>
        <p>People in my class were going crazy with excitement and audience members I had never met before were coming up to me, congratulating me on my performace, and telling me I was their favorite performer. Even though I had only started dancing some 2.5 months ago, there were people who loved watching me perform!</p>
        <p>Shortly after that, they lined all the finalist up on a red carpet, the remaining 6 couples out of 112, and had us walk out onto the floor 1 by 1. When I stepped past the curtain and saw the flashing lights, people cheering for me and screaming my number, I knew:</p>
        <p>This was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p>My partner and I placed 5th that day, but I had the bug... and it wasn't one I was inclined to pull out.</p>
        <p>Since then, I've competed in a more competitions and have frequently made my way back to the final round, even going as far as to win 1st place for one of my events. I still have a long way to go, but if I have learned anything since I started dancing its:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You're never to old or too late to start dancing.</li>
            <li>There's a style of dance for everyone.</li>
            <li>Dancing brings a certain light and joy that nothing else can.</li>
            <li>You don't need to be a professional to have a good time</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, get out there! Find a style of dance you love and stick with it! It may be Ballroom like it was for me, or it may be Folk Dance, Ballet, or even Hip-Hop/Street Dance. There is no correct form of dance. Pick the one that makes you smile, the one that makes you want to come back to it again and again. Chose to Dance. </p>
