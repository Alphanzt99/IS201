                <p>Working out has numerous benifits with little to no draw backs. Of those benifits, I've listed
                    several
                    of the benifits that I have perosonally seen in my life: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Weight Control</li>
                    <li>Combat Negative Health Conditions & Diseases</li>
                    <li>Improves Mood</li>
                    <li>Reduces Stress</li>
                    <li>Boosts Energy</li>
                    <li>Promotes Better Sleep</li>

                <p> This list is just the beginning, and these are the benefits that science has listed!
                    If you follow the principles of healthy living and exercise that are promised/implied in the
                    scriptures,
                    a long and healthy life full of blessings is headed your way.

                <h3 id="start"> How Do I start?</h3>
                <p>This is the question that most people struggle with. They get to the point where they realize that
                    they want to Workout and they are able to recognize the health benifits that it will bring them if
                    they want to start,
                    but they just aren't sure where to go. Fear not! There are dozens of resources that
                    we can use to find out which kind of exercise is best for you!
                </p>
                <p>The most imporant aspect is to be consistent! In any and all efforts to improve yourself, consistency
                    is key.
                    One way to help with that consistency is to have a workout routiene. People often refer to these as
                    "Splits".
                    Below are the most common splits that most people, beginner and professional, chose to follow when
                    getting into/continuing with personal fitness. Each one has specific focuses, which I'll include
                    below.
                </p>

                <hr id="skills" style="width: 1000px;">
                <h3>Is there any skills I should have before I start?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but they might not be what you think! One of the most basic skills that you should have in the gym
                    is the ability to do simple math. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. You don't have to know how 
                    to do diffrential equations or understand the pythagorean theorem to lift weights, nor do you need an 
                    understanding of physics, though that can help to a degree!  
                </p>
                <p>If you want to test your math skills, here's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="html/barbell_game.html">Barbell Weight Calculation</a> game 
                where you'll be presented with a number and are supposed to add weight on until it meets it. The weight increments are 
                pretty standard to what you'll find in most gyms, so it'll be good practice! </p>
                <p>In addition to basic math skills, it's important to have good manners! You might not think it, but most people 
                    who work out in gyms are very polite and complimentary of each other. Recognizing when you're in someones way 
                    and moving for them or not hogging a mirror is considered basic manners, as well as asking if anyone is using 
                    a specific piece of equipment or weight before taking it, especially if it near someone. 
                </p>
                <p>The last skills I would argue as most important are humility and dedication. There will be people who 
                    have been working out for years, and their bodies will show it. Don't discourage or berate yourself for not looking 
                    like someone who has spent the past 5 or 10 years working to look like that. Be humble and recognize your 
                    ability to grow, then dedicate yourself to meeting your potential! 
                </p>
                <p>In addition to that, humility also take the form of constantly looking for ways to improve! Do your research on
                    proper lifting form and find ways to work your body efficently and safely, so you don't injure yourself and 
                    make it hard or impossible to workout for the next few weeks, months, or even years!
                </p>
